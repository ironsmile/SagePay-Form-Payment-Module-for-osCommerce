All references to Protx have been removed and replaced with Sagepay within the code and all filenames.

protx --> sagepay
Protx --> Sagepay
PROTX --> SAGEPAY

Corrected minor spelling mistake and error in installation instructions

note: Spanish and German versions are still in English... these should be translated prior to use.

sagepay_form-v1.19
URL modifications as a result of PROTX becoming SAGEPAY

Note added to the installation instructions about compy name change as there are many remaining references to Protx in the code.
Modified live and test addresses to point to new Sagepay URLs instead of Protx. 
Removed the commented out references to defunct Protx URLs

...Further work is required to tidy up coding to remove all reference to Protx but this is not essential from a functional perspective.

Adjusted the handling of adding items to the Basket variable so as to restrict

protx_form-V1.16 - Change to VendorTxCode to produce extra uniqueness
*all suggestions courtesy of theINtoy*

The changes to the code here are minor, but to take care of any issues on non-uniqueness
1.  The store name is now taken from the PROTX form as this has to be unique
		(oscommerce stores have the potential to be named the same)

2.  The customers ID has been added to the end of this string,so that it will reduce the potential 
		for 2 seperate customers buying something at EXACTLY the same second.
		Now their ID added will make the extra difference required

Line 130 - added $customer_id to the global line to fetch it.
Changed     global $order, $currencies, $currency;
to	    global $order, $currencies, $currency, $customer_id;

Line 142 - changed the STORE_NAME reference to be the same as PROTX STORE NAME, added $customer_id after the date/time
		this will keep the references in order still as it is only the customers ID at the end for uniqueness.
Changed      $plain = "VendorTxCode=" . STORE_NAME . date('YmdHis') . "&";
to           $plain = "VendorTxCode=" . MODULE_PAYMENT_PROTX_FORM_VENDOR_NAME . date('YmdHis') . $customer_id . "&";

NOTE: You could change this to include some kind of dividers between each part of the reference 
seperating "store name_datetime_customerid"
e.g.  $plain = "VendorTxCode=" . MODULE_PAYMENT_PROTX_FORM_VENDOR_NAME ."_" . date('YmdHis') . "_" . $customer_id . "&";

protx_form-V1.15 - Fix for VendorTxCode to add store name automatically

Changed the VendorTxCode so that it now adds your store name to the VendorTxCode automatically
to make your code unique as suggested by theINtoy.

Line 142
Changed       $plain = "VendorTxCode=" . date('YmdHis') . "&";
to	      $plain = "VendorTxCode=" . STORE_NAME . date('YmdHis') . "&";

protx_form-V1.14 - Fix for VendorTxCode
Changed the VendorTxCode so that it now uses a 24 hour clock for the hours. 
Changed       $plain = "VendorTxCode=" . date('Ymdhis') . "&";
to            $plain = "VendorTxCode=" . date('YmdHis') . "&";

NB. I personally believe that the VendoTxCode should have a unique identifier
either prepended or appended to this date to make it unique in the protx
system. As things stand the VendorTxCode has a chance of not being unique in
within Protx if 2 protx clients attempt to submit at the same second. This
could happen.

protx_form-v1.13 Added global $order on line 17 and changed submittion URL's for updated Protx ones

Line 17 global $order added

Line 31-39 were changed to NEW URL's also added a line to include a reference to the OLD URLs

Line 31-39 used to be
      if (MODULE_PAYMENT_PROTX_FORM_TEST_STATUS == 'true') {
        $this->form_action_url = 'https://ukvpstest.protx.com/vps2form/submit.asp';
		//$this->form_action_url = 'https://ukvpstest.protx.com/showpost/showpost.asp';
		//$this->form_action_url = 'https://ukvpstest.protx.com/VSPSimulator/VSPFormGateway.asp';
	 //	$this->form_action_url = '../../decrypt_protx.php';
      } else {
        $this->form_action_url = 'https://ukvps.protx.com/vps2form/submit.asp';
      }
    }


Line 31-42 now is
      if (MODULE_PAYMENT_PROTX_FORM_TEST_STATUS == 'true') {
        $this->form_action_url = 'https://ukvpstest.protx.com/vspgateway/service/vspform-register.vsp';
        //old LIVE URL was https://ukvpstest.protx.com/vps2form/submit.asp
		//$this->form_action_url = 'https://ukvpstest.protx.com/showpost/showpost.asp';
		//$this->form_action_url = 'https://ukvpstest.protx.com/VSPSimulator/VSPFormGateway.asp';
        //$this->form_action_url = '../../decrypt_protx.php';

      } else {
        $this->form_action_url = 'https://ukvps.protx.com/vspgateway/service/vspform-register.vsp ';
        //old LIVE URL was https://ukvps.protx.com/vps2form/submit.asp
      }
    }

protx_form-v1.12 Fixed 'C' and 'c' problem as Protx Servers have been corrected.

On the LIVE and TEST servers they should now be small 'c' in the CRYPT lines.

Lines 230 and 239 changed back from previous update.

Please NOTE that the url for submiting the forms to will be changed as of 1st Aug.
I will change and post this update when it occurs.

15 July 2007
------------
protx_form-v1.0.11 Fixed Crypt Error, Removed previous Vendor's Tx Code, Removed invalid Test Card info
relates to catalog\includes\modules\payments\protx_form.php

*Test Card info removed
Line 114
Changed                    'module' => $this->title . "<br>" . $this->description );
to                         'module' => $this->title);

*Crypt Error - for TEST server
Line 230 and 239 - "Courtesy of Fernyburn" this was a great discovery from another user and I working together to solve the problem of Protx always returning to the checkout_payment screen with an "=error_message" in the URL at the end.
This resulted in the transaction being paid for through Protx, but osCommerce not registering it as an order/sale.
Fernyburn gets all credit for this one.

Line 230
Changed                                tep_draw_hidden_field('crypt', $crypt);
to                                     tep_draw_hidden_field('Crypt', $crypt);

Line 239
Changed       $crypt = $_REQUEST['crypt'];
to            $crypt = $_REQUEST['Crypt'];                NOTE: the capital 'C'in ['Crypt]

apparently on the LIVE server these should both be changed back to small 'c'


*Removal of previous Vendor's TxCode
Line 138
Changed       $plain = "VendorTxCode=theINtoy_" . date('Ymdhis') . "&";
to            $plain = "VendorTxCode=" . date('Ymdhis') . "&";

* this update includes the previous fixes detailed below - I felt this deserved a new version number hence the
protx_form-v1.0.11


13 July 2007
------------
protx_form-v1.0.10 Fixed Description for Module

* Fixed formatting of module on Admin section and on Customer Payment Section.

Changed line 20 from
      $this->description = MODULE_PAYMENT_PROTX_FORM_TEXT_PICTURE;

to
      $this->description = MODULE_PAYMENT_PROTX_FORM_TEXT_DESCRIPTION;


13 July 2007
------------
protx_form-v1.0.10 Fix for orders greater than �999.99.

* Fix for final order totals that are greater than �999.99.
* Fix removes "," seperator from ie. �1,872.32 ----->  �1872.32  (removing it in osAdmin is not enough)

 Line 139 altered from

      $plain .= "Amount=" . number_format($order->info['total'] * $currencies->get_value($protx_currency), $currencies->get_decimal_places($protx_currency)) . "&";

to

      $plain .= "Amount=" . number_format($order->info['total'] * $currencies->get_value($protx_currency), $currencies->get_decimal_places($protx_currency), '.', '') . "&";

As per usual - always back up


08 July 2007
------------
protx_form-V1.0.10
Building on the 1.0.9 Intermediate, this version contains the following fix
and update:

* Fix for redirect when customer hits "Cancel" on the Protx payment form and is
redirected back to osC

* added the ablity for decrypt_protx.php to log to file instead of showing the
message on the browser. This is useful when debugging is needed on a live
server, as the user will get a message saying there is a problem, but the log
will contain all the details.


04 January 2007
-----------------
protx_form-V1.0.9 Intermediate

The following version contains all the following intermediate updates:

Fix for success redirect error - 2 - 26 Dec 2006
Miss VAT on selected options - 27 Jul 2006
Protx redirect to checkout_process.php problem - 11 May 2006
Fix for success redirect error - 08 Nov 2005



20 October2005
-----------------
protx_form-V1.0.9

If the product description contained colons (:), or the cart string contained 
carriage returns or line-feeds it caused an invalid transaction with PROTX.
This version fixes these bugs.



23 September 2005
-----------------
protx_form-V1.0.8

Allows you to send the shopping cart contents to Protx. 
These will then appear on the customers confirmation email from 
Protx and the 'Protx VSP SUCCESS notification' email to the shop owner. 
It works for me but I may have not used all of the tep functions 
available and I have not tested it with free shipping.  
It is also updated to VPSProtocol 2.22  
Also included is a quick and dirty decode page 
so you can see what is being posted to Protx - 
Comment and un-comment lines around 
�if (MODULE_PAYMENT_PROTX_FORM_TEST_STATUS == 'true') {� 

07 April 2004
-------------
protx_form-V1.0.6

Added Pre-Authorisation facility.
