************************************************************************


PLEASE NOTE

decrypt_sagepay.php is not needed except for de-bugging and does not have to be uploaded to the live site.

To use decrypt_sagepay.php navigate to line 87 which should look like this:

$de_crypt = SimpleXor(base64_decode($Crypt),'geavj7yt4G6Wiy8x');

the string 'geavj7yt4G6Wiy8x' is a fake PROTX password. 

You must substitute yours (the same one you enter in the admin panel) here for decrypt_sagepay.php to work.

then go to around line 30 in sagepay_form.php 

            if (MODULE_PAYMENT_PROTX_FORM_TEST_STATUS == 'true') {
        $this->form_action_url = 'https://test.sagepay.com/vps2form/submit.asp';
        //$this->form_action_url = '../../decrypt_sagepay.php'

and uncomment the  line $this->form_action_url = '../../decrypt_sagepay.php';
